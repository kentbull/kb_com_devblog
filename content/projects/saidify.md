A TypeScript library for computing Self-Addressing Identifiers (SAIDs) as defined in the IETF SAID specification. SAIDs provide a cryptographic digest that is embedded within the data structure it digests, enabling self-referential integrity verification. Essential tooling for building KERI and ACDC applications in JavaScript/TypeScript environments.
