Computes self-addressing identifiers (SAIDs) for KERI and ACDC schema parts and links them together by SAID. KASLCred automates the tedious process of SAIDifying credential schemas and establishing the cryptographic links between schema components. Built on KERIpy and the Rust-based Blake3 cryptographic library.
