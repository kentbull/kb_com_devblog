# White-paper Review: Privacy-preserving auditable token payments in a permissioned blockchain system


I disagree with and do not endorse the model used for the Fabric Token SDK originates from the 2019 academic paper titled “[Privacy-preserving auditable token payments in a permissioned blockchain system](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1058.pdf)” due to it lacking a comprehensive model for agent based communication of transaction details. Using existing transaction transmission protocols puts at unnecessary risk the account and communication channel metadata occurring during the transaction submission and retrieval processes.

The lack of an agent based communication protocol for the F(STM) module in their model is a major shortcoming.
