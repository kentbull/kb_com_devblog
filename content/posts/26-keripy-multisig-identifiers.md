# KERIpy Technical Series: Demystifying Multi-Signature Identifiers

Creating multisig.

general architecture of multisig

challenge response with multisig

OOBIs with multisig

- multisig agent URLs in KERIA – strip off last AID in order to send to whole group. (why?)

multisig delegation

IPEX with multisig

multisig rotation

Use of Exchange messages in multisig group – everyone broadcasts exchange messages to each other?
