# KERIpy Technical Series: Demystifying Multi-Signature Identifiers

Creating multisig.

general architecture of multisig

challenge response with multisig

OOBIs with multisig

- multisig agent URLs in KERIA – strip off last AID in order to send to whole group. (why?)

multisig delegation

IPEX with multisig

multisig rotation

Use of Exchange messages in multisig group – everyone broadcasts exchange messages to each other?

INDEXED SIGNATURES! Make sure to describe the indexing schema, ordering, encoding, and decoding for indexed primitives. Indexed primitives are most important in the context of multisig since multiple signatures occur only with multisig operations. Thus understanding indexed primitives is a requirement.
