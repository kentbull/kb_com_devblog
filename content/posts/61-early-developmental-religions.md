# Early Developmental Religions


With regard to the maturation and growth of the soul Christianity, Mormonism, and Fundamentalist Polygamist Mormonism represent early developmental religions. By the word early I mean early in developmental phases of growth rather than necessarily early in the years of age in a religious adherent’s life.

Some religious ideas scale well in the early developmental phases and scale terribly in mid to late developmental phases. Conversely some scale poorly early on yet are the best show in town in the mid or late phases of life.
