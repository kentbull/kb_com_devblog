# Avoiding Identity Lock-In (Vendor lock-in)


Identity lock in happens when all of your identity data is locked in to a particular identity provider like Google, Meta (Facebook), Salesforce, Twitter, or otherwise, and this lock-in prevents you from taking your identity data with you to any site or ecosystem you want to participate in.
