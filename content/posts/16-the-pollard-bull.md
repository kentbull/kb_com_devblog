# The Pollard Bull

Hello to my YouTube audience! My prior personal channel is undergoing a rebrand with a new name, “The Pollard Bull.” Catch the [explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUyAcVdUsfo) for an in-depth explanation of the story behind the new name mixed in with a few good quotes. Essentially it represents a focusing of my content streams by me separating out my history and community activism effort stream from my personal and technical effort stream.

The Pollard Bull ([@thepollardbull](https://www.youtube.com/@thepollardbull)) -> for anything related to my past and my current community development efforts.

Kent Bull ([@kentbull](https://www.youtube.com/@kentbull)) -> where I go on full code nerd, uber geek mode on all things technical related to digital identity, cryptography, cryptocurrency, computer science, and related topics.

See you there!
