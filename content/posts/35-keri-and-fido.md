# KERI and FIDO

Session from 5/28/2024

Get the recording and regurgitate Sam’s argument here with some FIDO info, my thoughts, and a description of how to use it.

Notes from Henk:

How does FIDO2 relate to KERI, can KERI be integrated into FIDO2 or the other way around?FIDO2 could be used for authentication is witnesses – OOBI.FIDO2 is mostly to do more secure authentication factor to federated identifiers like OIDCThe problem is the use of barer tokens, they are vulnerable to known attacks.KERI AID replaces FIDO2 key pairs. KERI is better with key rotation.Even the blockchain-based solution did not solve key rotation in a safe way.
