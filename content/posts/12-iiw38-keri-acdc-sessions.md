It's been two weeks since the 38th bi-annual Internet Identity Workshop. The KERI community had a big showing with 19 sessions across three days.

This included a variety of sessions on the vLEI ecosystem, the Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation, the Trust Spanning Protocol, KERI basics, CESR 2.0, new Witness infrastructure, and business-focused sessions. A developing tradition of the "Bearer Tokens are bad, don't use them" session was held this year as well by Sam Smith titled "I don't sign my credentials and neither should you!"

See the list below for a complete reference of KERI sessions and their meeting notes.
