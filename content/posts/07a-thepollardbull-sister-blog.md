Announcing [ThePollardBull.com](https://thepollardbull.com), a sister site to kentbull.com, focused on my personal family history and community engagement with those in the groups I grew up in, namely the Davis County Cooperative Society (DCCS) and the Latter Day Church of Jesus Christ (LDCJC / LDCC). There I talk philosophy, history, and other cool things.

See the [Site Launch](https://thepollardbull.com/site-launch/) page for the introduction and the [Future Topics](https://thepollardbull.com/future-topics/) page for a listing of future topics the site seeks to detail.

Go check it out!
