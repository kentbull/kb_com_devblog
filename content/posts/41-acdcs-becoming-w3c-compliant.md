# ACDCs becoming W3C Compliant!

In other news, I have some very good news from the ACDC ecosystem. As an outcome of the Miami, Florida debate in the last few weeks in the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0 specification working group ACDCs are now being added to the 2.0 specification as a compliant data model.

This is great news for the ACDC ecosystem! If or when TitleChain uses KERI and ACDC it can say it is W3C compliant.

There are more technical details such as the one-way transformation of an ACDC to a JSON-LD credential and the precise timing of landing the ACDC language in the spec whether 2.0 or 2.1 that you can ask me about if you want more information.

This does not mean ACDCs are using RDF, what JSON-LD uses. It just means ACDCs can export to JSON-LD as needed to be consumed by targets that require JSON-LD. Targets compatible with the core ACDC spec need not worry about JSON-LD at all.
